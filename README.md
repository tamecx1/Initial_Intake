# TSO Initial Intake Chatbot

This repository contains the backend code and HTML structure for the TSO Initial Intake chatbot.
The chatbot collects SMT project intake data, generates a text file, and emails it to TSO.

## Structure

- `app.py` — Flask backend for API endpoints, project ID generation, and email sending.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies for deployment.
- `templates/index.html` — Placeholder UI page (will be replaced with the chatbot interface).

## Next Steps

- Connect the frontend chatbot UI.
- Deploy on Render or similar hosting platform.
- Configure SMTP credentials through environment variables.
